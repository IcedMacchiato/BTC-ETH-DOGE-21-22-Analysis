Due to the recent boom and decline of crypto within 2021 - 2022, I decided to analyze the trend of three popular crypto currrencies: 

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DogeCoin. 

Within this project, I took a look at the closing price, returns, correlations, and moving averages from 06/25/21 - 06/25/22 to get a general idea of what the market has gone through.
